# bookloop

BookLoop is a community-driven app where users can add 
and share used books by entering details like title, price,
author, and image. Registered users can buy, sell, or exchange 
books face- to-face by marking a meeting locationâ€”no online
payments required. After each transaction, users can 
rate each other to build trust.
